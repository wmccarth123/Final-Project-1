## Introduction
### Our Task 

We are a new new business group at a Pennsylvania Asset Management firm tasked with leading the firms integration effort of digital assets with traditional investment porfolios. The firm is interested in exploring risk profile of digital assets and how they may be combined with traditional investment portfolios for investors with Conservative, Moderate, & Agressive risk appetite. Our task is to compare the risk profile of Digital Asset with Traditional Asset (ETFs, Mutual Funds) and recommend combination of the asset types for investor intersted in a exposure to this 'new' asset class. Then gather demographic data (such as Avg income) in the state, to consider a marketing strategy for potential new funds. 

For this Analysis we will need to answer: 

1. Analyse the risk profile of Bitcoin & Eethereum: How do Ethereum and Bitcoin compare with the broader market, as represented by S&P500 Index?
2. Analyze the results of the last 5 years for a traditonal Conservative, Moderate, & Agressive Porfolio for a baseline.
3. Recomend how much of each Digital Assets should be combined with each Traditonal profilio & anlayze the outcome
4. Anlayze Pennsylvania Census Data to recommend markets for each Porfolio

## Data Sources 
Data for this analysis was found in three parts: 
1. We research the make up of Traditional Pofolios & incorprated assets that fit the risk profolio of each profilio. 
* Conservative includes: BIV, BSV, VB, VV, VXUS
* Moderate & Agressive include: BND, VB, VV, VWO, VXUS

(Data Soruce API saved as csv)

2. Bitcoin & Eethereum choosen for thier breath of data & Name recongnition to novice digital investors 

(Data Soruce from Google Finance for the last 5 years & saved as a CSV)
3. S&P data from Google Finance 

4. PA Market Data: Household Income Data Sourced from Kaggle pull from Census API

## Results, Conclusions, & Implications
Based on our analysis our recomendations for integrating digital assets into traditional investment profilios are as follows: Conservative 2% digital, Moderate 5% digital, Agressive 10% digital. 

Test Results 
Results: Average yearly returns
* Conservative +6.9%
* Moderate +13.3%
* Agressive +22.1%

Results: Monte Carlo Ratio
* Conservative +3.0%
* Moderate +7.5%
* Agressive +12.2%

Results: Beta change
* Conservative +.26
* Moderate +1.0
* Agressive +1.7

Results: Sharpe Ratio change
* Conservative +.36
* Moderate +.55
* Agressive +.87 (1)

(Note: unexpected result that the sharpe ratio of an agressive digital belended portfolio produced a higher Sharpe Ratio)

Conclusion:
After combining the digital assets with traditional investment porfolios we found that digital assets raised the average yearly returns as expected. The results of a 1 year forward looking Monte Carlo simulation confimed these results. Based on the volitility metrics, the digital assets increased risk and volitlity substantially for conservative and moderate investors. Therefore, the firm should target an agressive investor, with a high risk tolerance, with a higher beta traditonal portfolio combined with a higher allocation (10%) digital assets. Based on the Greater Philadelphia Market household income data our firm will be tageting indiviuals in the citys of Philadelphia, West Chester, Ardmore, and Wayne as they have the largest average hosuehold incomes. Assumption being that households with higher incomes have higher savings. Therefore these households will have a higher risk tolorence.

Implications: 
The real world implication of this analysis are far more complex due to the complexity of the modern ivestor. In a real life scienero not all investors are the same. Thus they will not always follow the exact risk profilie identified in this analysis. An example of this could be a traditonal agressive investor that wants to get into the digital asset market. When presented with the outcomes of our analysis they decide that the increased risk is not worth the increased return. But, we could pitch to this individual that he/she can achive similar returns for less risk & be in the digital asset market by choosing the conservative profolio integrated with digital assets. Which has compareable returns but lowers risk while postioning them in the digital market.
